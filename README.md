# Airlines-Data-Analysis
A complete Airline Data Analysis project that uses SQL for data extraction and Python for exploratory data analysis (EDA) to answer business questions and derive insights from airline operational data.
I’ve completed an end-to-end Airline Data Analysis project where I combined 
📌 SQL for data extraction 
📌 Python for EDA & visualization

🔍 Key work done:
✔️ Data cleaning & preprocessing  
✔️ SQL queries for business questions  
✔️ Exploratory Data Analysis using Pandas  
✔️ Visual insights with Matplotlib & Seaborn  

📊 Key insights included:
• Flight Ticket Prices 
• Airline performance comparison  
• Cancellation analysis  



This project helped me understand how real-world data analysis works in the airline domain.
